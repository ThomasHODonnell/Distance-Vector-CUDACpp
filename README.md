# Compute Distance Vectors
- This program computes various distance vectors between some scaled data and a reference point. 
- It is intended to implement a few basic Cuda concepts so I can have a reference for more challenging projects in the future. 
  - Namely, provide device configuration and a platform to adjust runtime parameters based on system hardware. 
  - Demonstrate a unified memory model.
  - Show synchronus and asynchronus error checking in memory allocation and kernel execution.
  - Implement program structure with multiple files/headers to show best practices for large codebases in the future.
